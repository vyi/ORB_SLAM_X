#### ORBSLAM implementation for 1,2 and 3

The first repo is from the official channel. Rest two repo's are sourced from https://github.com/RAFALAMAO/

The CMakeLists.txt are modified to compile with openCV3. 

The ORBSLAM 1, does work but the visualization in RViz does not work for some reason. 

The ORBSLAM2,3 both work and visualization works well (it uses pangolin)
